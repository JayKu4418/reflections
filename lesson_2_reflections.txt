What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created when you initialize a repository. By doing this, we can start having version control on the files found in the folder. We can commit files and have different versions of the files over time. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to package a bunch of commits you might have over multiple files to allow you to make a single commit. It also gives you a chance to think about what your logical change is and whether it makes sense. It is a temporary spot compared to your working directory and repository since files will not remain there.
